Trainable ISTA (TISTA) for sparse signal recovery

This code is an implementation of Trainable ISTA (TISTA) for sparse signal recovery in PyTorch.
The details of the algorithm can be found in the paper:
Daisuke Ito, Satoshi Takabe, Tadashi Wadayama,
"Trainable ISTA for Sparse Signal Recovery", arXiv:1801.01978.
(Computer experiments in the paper was performed with another TensorFlow implementation)

GPU is required for execution of this program. If you do not have GPU,
remove .cuda() from the following code.
